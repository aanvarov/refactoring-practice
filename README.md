# Refactoring practice
Repository where I practice refactoring. I find refactoring tasks and open source projects and refactor them to follow SOLID

Found a video with a task to refactor given code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eY2IomNcz4  
Before refactoring: https://pastebin.com/RSc7Uvqx  
  
The app is a primitive emulator of RPG mechanics. User as a character has a number of points that can be spent on abilities. Following DRY and SOLID, I made the solution more dynamic - abilities can be easily added or removed without crash for the app.
